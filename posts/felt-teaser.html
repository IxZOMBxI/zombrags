<p>ðŸª¡ Felt Character Teaser</p>

<p>Something stitched this way comesâ€¦</p>

<p>A shadow has taken shape in wool and cord.  
The brain void waits. The pendant cavity whispers.  
But the figure itself remains unseen.</p>

<h3>What you can expect:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Stubby, totem-like form with cyberpunk stitch lines.</li>
  <li>Clay eyes and a brain youâ€™ll swap and collect.</li>
  <li>Paracord guts binding a relic deep inside.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider this your warning. The felt unit is real.  
Itâ€™s just not ready to step into the light.</p>
