<p>ðŸ”¥ Welcome to the Horde</p>

<p>Survival isnâ€™t just a theme â€” itâ€™s the code we live by.</p>

<p>Zomb Rags isnâ€™t here to blend in.
Weâ€™re here to make survival look like art â€” to turn every scar, glitch, and tear into something worth wearing. This brand is built for the ones whoâ€™ve been through hell and came back with teeth still showing.</p>

<p>Every drop is limited. No mass production. No endless restocks. When you wear Zomb Rags, youâ€™re part of something rare â€” a signal in the noise.</p>

<h3>Over the coming months, expect:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bespoke techwear accessories that blur the line between utility and style.</li>
  <li>Cyberpunk leatherwork designed for modern-day scavengers and survivors.</li>
  <li>Behind-the-scenes looks at how each piece is made â€” raw, unfiltered, and unapologetic.</li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™ve found your way here, youâ€™re already part of The Horde.<br>
Stay sharp. Stay moving.<br>
And remember â€” we see you.</p>
