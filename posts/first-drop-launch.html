<p>Welcome to the first ZOMB RAGS drop. We built this line under pressure, in the ruins, with a focus on survival-grade comfort and cyberpunk tactility.</p>

<h2>The Fabric Story</h2>
<p>We chose dense knits, reinforced seams, and matte hardware. Nothing fragile. Nothing flashy without purpose.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hidden zipper channels</li>
  <li>Modular strap points</li>
  <li>Heat-set logos to survive wear</li>
</ul>

<p>Drop dates, behind-the-scenes photos, and the full lookbook will be revealed soon. <a href="../index.html">Back to the Horde.</a></p>
