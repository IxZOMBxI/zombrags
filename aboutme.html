      <p><strong>Survival isn’t just a theme — it’s the code we live by.</strong></p>

      <p>Zomb Rags is a fusion of cyberpunk aesthetics, survival-grade durability, and bespoke craft. 
      We don’t follow trends — we design for the ones who’ve been through hell, taken the hits, and kept moving. 
      Every piece is built to outlast, both in style and in function.</p>

      <p>The brand was born from the idea that clothing and accessories should do more than just look good — they should tell a story. 
      A story of grit, resilience, and never backing down. Each drop is limited, making every item a rare artifact in a world of disposable fashion.</p>

      <h2>The Mission</h2>
      <p>To create high-end, functional techwear and accessories that merge utility with art — a visual language for the modern scavenger.</p>

      <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bespoke Design:</strong> Each piece is tailored for durability, style, and function.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Drops:</strong> No mass production. No endless restocks. When it’s gone, it’s gone.</li>
        <li><strong>Raw Process:</strong> We show the behind-the-scenes — unfiltered, unpolished, real.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Horde</h2>
      <p>If you’ve made it here, you’re already one of us. The Horde is more than a community — it’s a network of survivors, makers, and rebels who refuse to fade into the noise.</p>

      <p><em>Stay sharp. Stay moving. And remember — we see you.</em></p>
