# 🔥 Welcome to the Horde — Zomb Rags

**Survival isn’t just a theme — it’s the code we live by.**

Zomb Rags isn’t here to blend in.  
We make survival look like art — turning every scar, glitch, and tear into something worth wearing.  
This brand is built for the ones who’ve been through hell and came back with teeth still showing.

Every drop is **limited**. No mass production. No endless restocks.  
When you wear Zomb Rags, you’re part of something rare — a signal in the noise.
